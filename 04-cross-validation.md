How do we know that a model is *good enough*?

In the previous section, we managed to reduce the SSE substantially relative to
the linear model, by fitting a non-linear one, but it's still not perfect. How about
trying a more complicated model, with more parameters? Another function that is
often used to fit psychometric data is the Weibull cumulative distribution
function, named after the great Swedish mathematician and engineer [Waloddi
Weibull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waloddi_Weibull)


~~~ {.python}

def weibull(x, threshx, slope, lower_asymp, upper_asymp):
    """
    The Weibull cumulative distribution function

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float or array
       The values of x over which to evaluate the cumulative Weibull function

    threshx : float
       The value of x at the deflection point of the function.
       For a lower_asymp set to 0.5, this is at approximately y=0.81

    slope : float
        The slope of the function at the deflection point.

    lower_asymp : float
        The lower asymptote of the function

    upper_asymp : float
        The upper asymptote of the function.
    """
    threshy = 1 - (lower_asymp * np.exp(-1))
    k = (-np.log((1 - threshy) / (lower_asymp))) ** (1 / slope)
    m = (lower_asymp + upper_asymp - 1) * np.exp(-(k * x / threshx) ** slope)
    return upper_asymp - m

~~~

As you can see, this function has several more parameters to account for
features of the data that may interest us.

Let's see what that might look like:

~~~ {.python}

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
ax.plot(x, weibull(x, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.95), label='threshx=0.5, slope=3.5, lower_asymp=0.5, upper_asymp=0.95')
ax.plot(x, weibull(x, 0.5, 3.5, 1, 0.95),  label='threshx=0.5, slope=3.5, lower_asymp=1, upper_asymp=0.95')
ax.plot(x, weibull(x, 0.5, 3.5, 1, 0.85), label='threshx=0.5, slope=3.5, lower_asymp=1, upper_asymp=0.85')
ax.plot(x, weibull(x, 0.25, 3.5, 0.5, 0.95), label='threshx=0.25, slope=3.5, lower_asymp=0.5, upper_asymp=0.95')
ax.plot(x, weibull(x, 0.75, 3.5, 1, 0.85), label='threshx=0.75, slope=3.5, lower_asymp=1, upper_asymp=0.85')
ax.grid('on')
fig.set_size_inches([14, 8])
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
~~~

We go ahead and fit this function as well, using `curve_fit`

~~~ {.python}

params_ortho, cov_ortho = opt.curve_fit(weibull, x_ortho, y_ortho)
params_para, cov_para = opt.curve_fit(weibull, x_para, y_para)
~~~

And examine the results:

~~~ {.python}

y_ortho_hat = weibull(x, params_ortho[0], params_ortho[1], params_ortho[2], params_ortho[3])
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
ax.plot(x, y_ortho_hat)
ax.plot(x_ortho, y_ortho, 'bo')

y_para_hat = weibull(x, params_para[0], params_para[1], params_para[2], params_para[3])
ax.plot(x, y_para_hat)
ax.plot(x_para, y_para, 'go')

ax.grid("on")
fig.set_size_inches([8, 8])

~~~

![Weibull fits](img/figure8.png)

Calculating the error, we find that the SSE is smaller for this model:

~~~ {.python}

SSE_para = np.sum((weibull(x_para, params_para[0], params_para[1], params_para[2], params_para[3]) - y_para) ** 2)
SSE_ortho = np.sum((weibull(x_ortho, params_ortho[0], params_ortho[1], params_ortho[2], params_ortho[3]) - y_ortho) ** 2)

~~~

Should we switch over to this model? It seems to be doing better in fitting the data.


## Overfitting

One of the reasons we should be suspicious of the more accurate second model is
that the Weibull function has more parameters. This is sometimes referred to as
the "degrees of freedom" of the model, and intuitively just means that the more
parameters a function has, the more adjustments you can make to the estimated $y$
values that you could consistently get across a range of $x$ values. Let's examine
the most extreme case of that. Consider the case of fitting a polynomial of
degree 6 to these data (7 parameters, including $\beta_0$):

~~~ {.python}

beta_ortho = np.polyfit(x_ortho, y_ortho, 6)
beta_para = np.polyfit(x_para, y_para, 6)

~~~

This model has even smaller error on the data:

~~~ {.python}

SE_ortho = np.sum((y_ortho - np.polyval(beta_ortho, x_ortho))**2)
SSE_para = np.sum((y_para - np.polyval(beta_para, x_para))**2)

~~~

But examining the curves of the fits, you can see that it does some absurd
things in order to fit the data:

![Fits of polynomials with degree 6](img/figure9.png)

That is, it bends to match not only the large-scale trends in the data, but also
the noise associated with each data point. This match to the noise that
characterizes the sample is called "overfitting".

Overfitting generally becomes worse as a model becomes more flexible. This can
roughly be quantified by the number of parameters in the model. That is, a
polynomial of degree 6 will always fit the data more accurately than a
polynomial of degree 5, only because of overfitting to the noise in the
sample.

## Overcoming overfitting -- model selection with cross-validation

One strategy to overcome overfitting is by separating the noise in the data used
to fit the model from the noise in the data used to evaluate the model. This is
called "cross-validation". We fit the model to one sample, and then evaluate it
on another. If we haven't collected two separate samples, it might still be safe
to assume that the noise in every individual observation (in the case of these
experiments, each trial) is independent, and we can generate two samples by
splitting the data up into sub-samples. There are different ways to split up the
data, but in this case it makes sense to separately look at odd trials and at
even trials, minimizing serial order effects (such as how tired the person got).

We refer to the sample used for fitting the model as the "training set". Using
the training set, we find the parameters of the model

~~~ {.python}

ortho_1 = ortho[::2]
x_ortho_1, y_ortho_1, n_ortho_1 = transform_data(ortho_train)
params_ortho_1, cov_ortho_1 = opt.curve_fit(cumgauss, x_ortho_1, y_ortho_1)

~~~

The left-out sample is called the "testing set". We use this sample to calculate
the error:

~~~ {.python}

ortho_2 = ortho[1::2]
x_ortho_2, y_ortho_2, n_ortho_2 = transform_data(ortho_train)
SSE_ortho_2 = np.sum((cumgauss(x_ortho_2, params_ortho_1[0], params_ortho_1[1]) - y_ortho_2) ** 2)

~~~

In order for this to be cross-validation, we would want to also do it the other
way around: use set \#2 as the training set and evaluate on the set \#1 as the
testing set:

~~~ {.python}

params_ortho_2, cov_ortho_2 = opt.curve_fit(cumgauss, x_ortho_2, y_ortho_2)
SSE_ortho_1 = np.sum((cumgauss(x_ortho_1, params_ortho_2[0], params_ortho_2[1]) - y_ortho_1) ** 2)

~~~
