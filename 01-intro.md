To understand why you would want to fit models in your research, let's first
consider an experiment in visual neuroscience (this experiment was conducted by
Ariel Rokem in collaboration with [Ayelet Landau](http://www.landaulab.com/ayelet-landau.html), and the data was collected
by Ayelet while she was at the Ernst StrÃ¼ngmann Institute in Frankfurt). The full story is
available in [a manuscript we wrote about these experiments](https://doi.org/10.1101/091553).

In these experiments, participants viewed a stimulus that contained a grating.
In each trial of the experiment two gratings were displayed in quick succession.

The first grating might look something like this:

![Surrounded grating](img/surrounded.png)

While the second would *always* look like this:

![Comparison grating](img/comparison.png)

In each trial of the experiment, participants had to say which of the gratings
(the first grating, or the second grating) had higher contrast.

> sensitive to small changes in contrast. That is, to small *differences* in
> luminance across the image.
> Grating stimuli, like the one we used, are often used in vision science to
> probe this sensitivity. This is a way for us to measure the effects
> of the presence of a surround on contrast perception. For example, it is well
> known that the relative orientation of the surround affects the degree to
> which the surround reduces the perceived contrast of the central patch.
> If the surrounding grating is parallel to the stimulus (as in the case shown
> above; also sometimes called 'co-linear'), it has a stronger effect on the
> perceived contrast (the contrast appears lower, just by virtue of the presence
> of the grating!). If the surrounding grating is orthogonal to the central
> patch, the effect is still there, but it is much weaker.

Let's look at the experimental data from one participant. We have two files from
this one subject in csv files, `scipy-optimize-data/ortho.csv` and `scipy-optimize-data/para.csv`. As their names suggest
they come from two different runs of the experiment: one in which the
surrounding stimulus was oriented in the parallel orientation relative to the
center stimulus  and one in which the surrounding stimulus was orthogonal to the
center stimulus. The files contain three columns: contrast1 is the contrast in
the first interval, contrast2 is the contrast in the second interval and answer
is what the participant thought had higher contrast. We will use the Pandas function
`pd.read_csv` to read the data into a [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html):

~~~ {.python}
import pandas as pd
ortho = pd.read_csv('../data/ortho.csv')
para = pd.read_csv('../data/para.csv')

~~~

We will not explain in much detail what Pandas does, except to mention that
the DataFrame that was created contains columns of data that can be addressed
by their name. For example, `ortho['contrast1']` contains a sequence of all
the contrasts shown during interval 1.

If you take a look at the data you will see that the contrast in the second
interval was always 0.3 (30% contrast). That's because this stimulus served as a
reference stimulus, to help participants as an anchor. In other experiments, we
also varied that, but, for the purpose for our analysis here, we can safely
ignore that column altogether and only look at the contrast in the first
interval. Let's take a look at the data. First, we are just going to plot the
raw data as it is. We will consider the contrasts as our independent variable,
and the responses as the dependent variables.

~~~ {.python}

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
# We apply a small vertical jitter to each point, just to show that there are
# multiple points at each location:
ax.plot(ortho['contrast1'], ortho['answer'] +
        np.random.randn(len(ortho)) * 0.02 , '*')
ax.plot(para['contrast1'], para['answer'] +
        np.random.randn(len(para)) * 0.02 , '+')
ax.set_ylim([0.9, 2.1])
ax.set_xlabel('Contrast 1')
ax.set_ylabel('Which stimulus had higher contrast? (1 or 2)')

~~~

There seems to be a trend in the data: the larger the contrast in the first
interval, the more likely the subject was to press the '1' button. That's a
reasonable thing to do, but it's hard to see and hard to quantify in this form.
Instead, we will transform this data into a plot in which the independent
variable is the contrast in interval 1 and the dependent variable is the
proportion of trials for which the subject pressed the '1' key for each
contrast. Let's define a function that will do that for us:

~~~ {.python}

def transform_data(data):
    """
    Function that takes experimental data and gives us the dependent/independent
    variables for analysis

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : rec array
        The data with records: `contrast1`, `contrast2` and `answer`

    Returns
    -------
    x : The unique contrast differences.
    y : The proportion of '1' answers in each contrast difference
    n : The number of trials in each x,y condition
    """
    x = np.unique(data["contrast1"])
    y = []
    n = []

    for c in x:
        sub = data[data["contrast1"] == c]
        n.append(sub.shape[0])
        y.append(sum(sub["answer"] == 1) / n[-1])

    return x,y,n
~~~

We separately transform the data into proportions for each one of the data files:

~~~ {.python}

x_ortho, y_ortho, n_ortho = transform_data(ortho)
x_para, y_para, n_para = transform_data(para)

~~~

And visualize that:


~~~ {.python}

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
# To plot each point with size proportional to the number of trials in that condition:
for x,y,n in zip(x_ortho, y_ortho, n_ortho):
    ax.plot(x, y, 'bo', markersize=n)

for x,y,n in zip(x_para, y_para, n_para):
    ax.plot(x, y, 'go', markersize=n)

ax.set_xlabel('Contrast in interval 1')
ax.set_ylabel('Proportion answers `1`')
ax.set_ylim([-0.1, 1.1])
ax.set_xlim([-0.1, 1.1])
ax.grid('on')
fig.set_size_inches([8,8])

~~~

Obviously there is a systematic relationship between the contrast and the
chances that this subject thought that the first interval had the higher
contrast. For example, when the contrast was much higher in interval 1 (e.g.
0.9), this person never said that the second interval had higher contrast.
Likewise, when the contrast was very low, this person almost never said that the
contrast in interval 1 had been higher. In the middle, there seems to be a
monotonic relationship between the variables. Also, notice that the two sets of
data (orthogonal and parallel) seem to be slightly different.

Can we say something more precise? For example, we might be interested in the
contrast for which answers of '1' and answers of '2' are equally likely. This is
known as the point of subjective equality (or PSE) and we can use it to compare
different conditions in this experiment and in other experiments, compare
different participants, etc.

In order to derive this quantity, or other quantities we approximate the data
with a continuous function. Given this function, we can ask what is the x value
of the function that corresponds to a y of exactly 0.5? This function is what we
will call here a "model". These functions usually describe the relationship
between dependent and independent variables through a set of some other
variables that we will call "model parameters". The computational process of
finding the values of the paramters that provide values of the model that
most accurately approximate the data is what we will call "model fitting".

### Why do we like models?

Models derived from data are useful for several reasons:

- **They allow you to explain the data you have**: summary statistics of the
  data, such as the mean of some variable, or the variance of this variable, are
  often not the best explanation of the data you have observed, in terms of the
  theory. For example, in the data we have observed in our experiment, a useful
  quantity is the PSE, which tells us what the perceived contrast of the
  surrounding grating was. This quantity is not readily present in summary
  statistics of the data. A functional form of a model is a mathematical formula
  that relates systematic changes in measured dependent variables, based on
  experimental manipulations of the independent variables. The functional form
  of the model varies with changes in model parameters. In the typical case,
  parameters are variables specificied in the model, that are neither your
  dependent variables nor your independent variables. If the model parameters
  correspond to theoretically meaningful quantities (such as the PSE), that can
  make the model useful in explaining the data and help test hypotheses about
  the theory behind the experiment.

- **They allow you to predict data you haven't collected**: In many cases,
  assuming that the parameters don't change with changes in the independent
  variables, models allow us to interpolate and predict what the dependent
  variables would have been like in other values of the independent variables.
  Even extrapolate to conditions that have not measured. For example, because
  measuring in these conditions is difficult for practical reasons.

-  **They allow us to build theories**: By applying a modeling approach to data,
   we can hope to build an incremental knowledge abouth the domain we are
   studying. For example, Newton's law of gravitation provides us with a
   quantitative prediction on the behavior of any two bodies. The observation
   that this model does not perform well in all conditions, led to Einstein's
   theory of general relativity, which provides a generalization of this law
   (or model).

In the following two sections, we will separately discuss linear models, and
contrast these with non-linear models.
