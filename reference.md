[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), by Gareth James,
Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani contains additional learning
on statistical and machine learning, including topics such as cross-validation.
The book is also accompanied by code written in R.

[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), by Trevor Hastie,
Robert Tisbshirani and Jerome Friedman is a more heavily mathematical treatment
of similar topics:

Leo Breiman's [The two cultures of statistical modeling](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726) makes some observations about
different approaches to models, their predictive, and explanatory power.


## Glossary

Model
:   A function that describes the relationship between dependent and
    independent variables in the data.

Model parameters
:   Variables of the model that are neiter dependent variables or independent
    variables in the data, but adjust the relationship between them, as
    described by the model. These sometimes correspond to underlying constructs
    of interest in the data. In some cases, additional calculations on the
    parameters can be used to make inferences about these constructs.
